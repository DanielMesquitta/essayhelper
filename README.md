# Essay Helper

## Description

The reason I started to code, a first project which aimed to help the lives of my classmates, as well as mine.

This was created as a personal project, with the goal to help people on the ENEM's essay counting number of characters, words and lines, using a spell checker underlining miss-typed words and
highlighting all the words that you repeated more than 3 times, being all customizable with parameters that can be changed.

## Functionalities

- Counter for the number of characters, words and lines,
- A spell checker underlining misstyped words,
- A tool that highlights all the words that you repeated more than 3 times,
- All Customizable with paramethers that can be changed.

Obs.: The spell checker that I used in this program is the default from the browser, so make shure that it's activated to work.

- Only hightlights words with 3 letters or more and with at least 3 repetitions,
- Every 66 characters you write a new line is added to the counter.
