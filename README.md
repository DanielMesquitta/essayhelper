## Functionalities

- Counter for the number of characters, words and lines,
- A spell checker underlining misstyped words,
- A tool that highlights all the words that you repeated more than 3 times,
- All Customizable with paramethers that can be changed.

Obs.: The spell checker that I used in this program is the default from the browser, so make shure that it's activated to work.

## Default Settings

- Only hightlights words with 3 letters or more and with at least 3 repetitions,
- Every 66 characters you write a new line is added to the counter.
