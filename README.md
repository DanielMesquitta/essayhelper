This is a website that is based on the ENEM's brazilian teste, it's site function is to help you become a better writer.

## Functionalities

- Counter for the number of characters, words and lines,
- A spell checker underlining misstyped words,
- A tool that highlights all the words that you repeated more than 3 times,
- Customizable tools, that can change the paramethers to find the repeated words.

Obs.: The spell checker that I used in this program is the standard from the browser, so make shure that it's activated to work. (If you use google you can check here: chrome://settings/languages )

## Default Settings

- Only hightlights words with 3 letters or more and with at least 3 repetitions,
